B4 you interact with us !!

1) Most of us are minors , Not to mention that first host is a minor too, so NSFW or anything over 18+ will not be tolerated ! ( Adults , interact with EXTREME care ! )
2) We switch alot in fronting, so please be patient with us ! we switch due to getting overwhelmed or personal reasons !
3) If Julez is fronting, then please interact with her carefully, she gets overwhelmed easily !
4) please ! and please again ! no disrespectful talk or bullying to us, we will act accordingly on our right.
5) Unless if close friends, don't make freaky jokes with us, seriously, we'll get disgusted.
